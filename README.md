# Notes_from_Codecademy_ML_course

This notebook contains the notes that I took during the ML course offered by Codecademy. It is in no way meant to be a substitute course and was only meant for personal reference/referesher after completion of the course.
I give full credit to Codecademy for providing me with the information necessary to build up this notebook, but examples and implementation are my own.
Please see the Codecademy "Fundamentals of Machine Learning" course information for more.
